<h1>Scrambled Eggs</h1>

<p>
So scrambled eggs with cheese are like the ultimate breakfast vibe. You just whip up some eggs until they’re nice and fluffy then toss them in a pan. When they start to set you throw in your favorite cheese like cheddar or mozzarella and it gets all melty and creamy. 
It’s super easy to make and honestly it hits the spot every time. Just sprinkle some salt and pepper maybe pair it with toast or fresh herbs and you’re good to go. Perfect for a chill morning!</p>
